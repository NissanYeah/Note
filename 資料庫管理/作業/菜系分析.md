### 菜色分析

題目：富二代想要進軍大陸市場，還為沒有決定產品，因此他想知道可以`推出什麼菜色`、最好的`進入城市`、`區域`，以及`定價`。

1. 大陸地區討論度最有市場潛力最好（需求量Ｘ利潤高）的菜色是什麼？

- 餐飲平均凈利潤率一般在8-10%，因此市場潛力約和「需求量＊平均單價」成正比


```sql
select dish.dishname, count(*) ,avg(shop.avgprice)* count(*) as profit,avg(shop.avgprice), avg(shopcomment.positivescore) ,avg(shopcomment.negativescore) from shop.shopdish, shop.shopcomment,shop.shop,shop.dish where dish.dishid = shopdish.dishid AND shopdish.shopid = shop.shopid AND shop.shopid = shopcomment.shopid group by dish.dishname order by 
profit DESC
```

- 發現「自助餐的」需求最高，討論熱度有1961條，選擇「自助餐」作為菜色

2. 自助餐需求最高的城市在哪裡？
